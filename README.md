# DIGITAL CLOCK
In this project, I successfully integrated a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module with a watch display using the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol. The primary objective was to edit the time and date by communicating with RTC. The successful integration of the RTC module with the watch display using the I2C communication protocol has resulted in a timekeeping solution that offers enhanced precision and user experience. This accomplishment highlights my ability to leverage communication technologies to deliver innovative solutions in the field of embedded systems and timekeeping devices. The project serves as a testament to my engineering capabilities and aptitude for developing intricate hardware-software interfaces, making it a valuable addition to my resume.
